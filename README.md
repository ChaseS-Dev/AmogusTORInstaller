Just a small Python script that tries to run steamcmd.exe, then download the correct depot version of Among Us. It also deletes the settings.amogus file located in locallow to fix the black screen bug. I wrote this for my lazy friend group.

Requires steamcmd.exe and TOR files to be located in the folder where the script is being run.
