Just a small Python script that tries to run steamcmd.exe, then download the correct depot version of Among Us. It also deletes the settings.amogus file located in locallow to fix the black screen bug. I wrote this because my friends are lazy.

Requires steamcmd.exe and TOR files to be located in the folder where the script is being run.
SteamCMD also requires that a user log in with their Steam account in order to download the depot files. This is done through steam, and none of your information is stored.
Weird side effect is that the game will not be able to connect online. Must restart Steam, then launch the new Among Us.exe in the created folder.
